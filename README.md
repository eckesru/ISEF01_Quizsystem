# ISEF01 Quizsystem

ISEF01 Quizsystem is a web application based on the Django framework which is designed to support students in preparing for their exams. This application enables users to cooperatively and collaboratively find and work out answers to academic questions. The popular "Gutefrage.net" platform served as inspiration, with additional components such as a quiz function being added.

This application was developed as part of the Project: Software Development-Course (ISEF01) at IU International University of Applied Sciences.
